# SD_2024_

Repository containing code and data for replication of the manuscript: "Multi-country settlement level database of health1 indicators and covariate-free estimation method"

# High-level overview:

There are two sets of instructions contained in this repository. 

1. Replication of the manuscript results and technical validation. It is restricted to 15 indicator and 10 countries included in the manuscript. 

2. Estimation of the 15 indicators for the most recent georeferenced DHS survey available for any country. It reproduces the results found in the library presented with this paper. 

The processed files are available on Borealis: (Add url)

# For replication of the manuscript estimates and technical validation:

## Where to start: 

1 - Select indicators and create the survey cluster DHS files with the scripts available with the accompanying detailed instructions in the [R_code](https://github.com/DiegoGBassani/SD_2024_Code/tree/main/R_code) folder.




2 - Save the resulting csv file, it should look like this one ([dataset_cluster.csv](https://github.com/DiegoGBassani/SD_2024_Code/tree/main/Python_code/Data/Globe/dataset_cluster.csv)) if you are replicating our findings. It will be larger if you include other countries or indicators.



3 - To replicate the estimation and validation steps, follow the [Instructions](https://github.com/DiegoGBassani/SD_2024_Code/blob/main/Python_code/ReadMe_SDManuscript.md) within the [Python_code](https://github.com/DiegoGBassani/SD_2024_Code/tree/main/Python_code) folder:
